# vscode-open

> Opens files using the OS's default program for the file type


## Install

Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and narrow down the list commands by typing `extension`. Pick `Extensions: Install Extension`.

Simply pick the `open` extension from the list.


## Usage

#### Open Shortcut

The extension can also be executed on demand

- **Mac**: <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>
- **Windows**: <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>

The command could also be found in the command palette (named `Open with default application`), or on the contextual menu in the file explorer.


## Roadmap

- Add support for selecting browser (feel free to send PR)


Have fun! :beers:
