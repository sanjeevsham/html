      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        The company was founded by Adolf "Adi" Dassler who made sports 
        shoes in his mother's scullery or laundry room in Herzogenaurach, 
        Germany after his return from World War I. In July 1924, his older 
        brother Rudolf joined the business, which became "Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory" 
        (Gebr√ºder Dassler Schuhfabrik). The electricity supply in Herzogenaurach was unreliable, 
        so the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment.

        India has been a very speculative market for Adidas.Despite this Dave Thomas,
        managing director of Adidas in India is ambitious of the country's potential.
        The company hopes to double its revenue from Rs. 805 crores by 2020. In 2015,
        the company had signed Ranveer Singh a prominent Bollywood actor as a brand ambassador to the company's products.
        Ranveer then was a budding actor. The company later decided to use the people's almost 
        religious adoration for the game cricket to promote their brand. It soon launched a new cricket 
        campaign in the country. The campaign was called FeelLoveUseHate with prominent Indian cricketer Virat Kohli. 
        However, in 2017, Virat Kohli was removed as the brand ambassador of the company.
        The cricketer later signed a major deal with Puma India. The company also sells its products online through 
        e-commerce websites such as Myntra, Snapdeal, Jabong and Amazon. Adidas also has a website dedicated to the Indian audience 
        that markets and sells products to its consumers in India.
